title = "“Always lowercase”"
+++

I always write my name entirely lowercase or uppercase -- even in formal settings, and even at the beginnings of sentences. **I ask that you do the same.**

There's a simple typographical reason: an uppercase `I` and a lowercase `l` look identical in many sans-serif fonts. And for many people, seeing my name with an initial capital letter results in misspellings and mispronunciation.

So it's easier for me and easier for everyone else if it's spelled lowercase (or in those rare official cases, all uppercase). Treat mixed case in my name as a misspelling. Thanks!
