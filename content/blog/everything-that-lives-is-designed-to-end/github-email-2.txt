Unfortunately it's still not clear what GitHub considers to be short
enough as you work to fix the UI issue.

If you can provide a clear, unambiguous limit for a temporary name
change I will be able to make the change.

But to clarify, that issue is affecting the UI of other GitHub users who haven’t starred or otherwise interacted with the repository (outside of the Explore page and emails). As a result, we received a large number of
reports from confused/affected users, which also impacted our ability to provide support to other users. I recognize I could’ve been more clear about that in my original reply, so I apologize for not having included more detail.
