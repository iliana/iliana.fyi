I have to apologize, because I said that given a precise limit, I would
make the change.

But 10 characters for each component does not reflect reality and is an
absurd request compared to these other repositories that happen to be
listed on github.com/trending:

https://github.com/GokuMohandas/practicalAI
https://github.com/MisterBooo/LeetCodeAnimation
https://github.com/scutan90/DeepLearning-500-questions
https://github.com/google-research/google-research

I've made the repository read-only, and stalled my final response in
order to make what I consider a sufficient backup of the repository and
related content. That backup is complete.

What happens with the repository is entirely in your hands at this
point. We're not going to protest any changes made by GitHub staff, but
we're not going to make them either.

I want to apologize as well for e98e's impact on your ability to provide
support to other users. That's not fair to you or users of GitHub. But I
must ask your organization to consider the following:

- If GitHub Support is significantly impacted by the load of users
  reporting a repository, is the current system for reporting
  repositories sustainable?

- Does your current system harm targets of widespread harassment? For
  example, if a person of color or a trans person builds a legitimate
  software project that becomes incredibly popular, does the current
  system effectively allow their harassers to disable the repository
  with no immediate recourse? (Will they not be given an initial
  response for 19 hours either?)

For the record, I've published two blog posts regarding this repository:
https://linuxwit.ch/blog/2018/12/e98e/
https://linuxwit.ch/blog/2018/12/everything-that-lives-is-designed-to-end/

And, finally: your development team should probably add a character
limit to the repository description field, lest this happen again:

Unless you have further questions or concerns, this will be my last
email to support regarding e98e.
