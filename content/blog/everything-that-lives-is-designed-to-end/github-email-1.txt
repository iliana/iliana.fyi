Actually, let me just be more blunt.

I don't think people reported this repository because the name or
description were disruptive; maybe that was the reason they gave staff,
but I think they reported it because they interpret it as a waste of
resources.

I'm not interested in shortening the repository name to appease these
people. I am willing to shorten the repository name to help resolve any
*purely technical* concerns of GitHub staff provided sufficient reason
for doing so. For instance, if you were to decrease the maximum length
of a combined username + repository name, I would be willing to comply
with that.

But anybody can make repository names of this length still. The only
reason mine was disabled was because it was popular enough to distract
people who... do what? Use the Explore email?

This repository turned into a really cool art project that a lot of
people care about. The length of e's doesn't matter. But it's really sad
that GitHub staff is bothering to listen to people who think that the
repository doesn't have a serious purpose.
