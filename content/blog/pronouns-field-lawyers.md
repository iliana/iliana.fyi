**Step 1:** Ask a corporate lawyer what they think.[^explanation]

[^explanation]:
    GitHub finally added a pronouns field to profiles today, with the following disclaimer devoid of meaning: _"Your pronouns will be visible to fellow users across GitHub, including where local laws restrict using pronouns other than those assigned at birth."_ It is rather unfortunate that GitHub chose to tarnish an otherwise good implementation with what reads like a threat.

    (This is not the first time I've watched corporate lawyers fuck this up.)
